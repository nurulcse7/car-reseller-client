            It’s simple. You get more for your money. New cars depreciate around
            20% during the first year of ownership and 15-18% each following
            year. That means you can score an excellent price on a slightly used
            vehicle in superb condition that’s good to go for many years and
            miles into the future. And because depreciation significantly lowers
            the cost of a pre-owned vehicle, you can opt for a make and model
            with additional options and features, which gets you more for your
            money than when buying a new one. With the money you save buying
            used, you can afford additional features like a moonroof, adaptive
            cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and dual-zone climate
            control. Not to mention, there’s more accessibility when it comes to
            purchasing your dream car, too.

            Buying a used car not only saves you money, but when you purchase a

            components, and it also provides roadside assistance. Wherever you
            happen to be in the continental U.S., help is just a toll-free phone
            call away, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. So
            when you drive away in your new-to-you vehicle, whether it’s a BMW
            3-Series or a Toyota Camry, you know you’re covered wherever your
            travels take you.
